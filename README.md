# 2048 Game
Welcome to the 2048 game! This implementation of the popular puzzle game has been created by Jiacheng (Jackie) Chen using Java.

### Game Description
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile and achieve the highest score possible. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where tiles can slide in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with double the value. After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 is randomly generated on an empty spot. The game ends when there are no more valid moves available.

This implementation faithfully replicates the behavior and rules of the original 2048 game.

### How to Play
To play the game, follow these simple steps:

 - The game will display the initial state of the 4x4 grid.
 - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide the tiles in the corresponding direction.
 - After each move, a new tile will be randomly generated on an empty spot.
 - Try to combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers and reach the 2048 tile.
 - The game ends when there are no more valid moves available.
 - The final score will be displayed, and you can choose to play again if desired.
